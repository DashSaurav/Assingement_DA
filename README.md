</br><b> Question-4.</b>
</br>Formally, a vector space V' is a subspace of a vector space V if
</br>V' is a vector space every element of V′ is also an element of V.
</br>Note that ordered pairs of real numbers (a,b) a,b∈R form a vector space V. Which of the following is a subspace of V?
</br>1. The set of pairs (a, a + 1) for all real a
</br>2. The set of pairs (a, b) for all real a ≥ b
</br>3. The set of pairs (a, 2a) for all real a
</br>4. The set of pairs (a, b) for all non-negative real a,b

</br><b>Answer-4.</b>
</br>1. Yes, set of pairs (a, a + 1) for all real a will be a subspace of V.
</br>2. No, set of pairs (a, b) for all real a ≥ b will not lie in subspace of V as b can become negative in some cases as a=1 and b will become 1 or -∞.
</br>3. Yes, set of pairs (a, 2a) for all real a will be a subspace of V.
</br>4. Yes, set of pairs (a, b) for all non-negative real a,b will be a subspace of V.


</br><b> Steps to run the question-3 in local system</b>
</br>1. pip install streamlit in directory or cmd prompt.
</br>2. pip install Textblob
</br>3. in same directory , streamlit run app.py
